Developed an interactive Multi-Site Performance Dashboard in Power BI to visualize KPIs, trends, and category performance. While the dataset used retail sales figures, the design and methods are directly applicable to Warehouse Management Systems (WMS) — such as monitoring stock levels, inbound/outbound shipment volumes, and site-wise operational performance. The project demonstrates skills in data modeling, DAX calculations, KPI creation, and interactive filtering, all of which are essential for C_Net’s warehouse analytics requirements.
